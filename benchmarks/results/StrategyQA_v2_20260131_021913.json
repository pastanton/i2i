But you usually won\u2019t notice it because sweat can\u2019t evaporate to cool you, and the surrounding water dilutes and washes it away. Also, being immersed (especially in cooler water) tends to reduce sweating because water conducts heat away efficiently and wet skin/pressure can suppress sweat gland output.",

        "openai/gpt-5.2": "Yes\u2014you can still *produce* sweat underwater because your sweat glands can secrete fluid regardless of being submerged.\n\nWhat changes is the effect: sweat won\u2019t *evaporate* underwater, so it doesn\u2019t provide the usual evaporative cooling. Instead, the sweat just mixes with the surrounding water (and may be hard to notice), while your body mainly gains or loses heat through conduction and convection with the water.",
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5": "Yes, you can sweat underwater, but you won't notice it.\n\nYour sweat glands continue to function normally when submerged, producing sweat in response to heat or exertion. However, the sweat is immediately diluted and washed away by the surrounding water, making it impossible to see or feel. This is why you might not realize you're sweating during activities like swimming, even though your body is still working to regulate its temperature.",
        "google/gemini-3-flash-preview": "Yes. Your body produces sweat to regulate temperature regardless of the surrounding environment. However, because water conducts heat away from the body more efficiently than air, you typically sweat less unless the water is very warm or the exercise is intense.",
        "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick": "No, humans cannot sweat underwater because sweat evaporates to cool the body, and evaporation doesn't occur underwater.",
        "x-ai/grok-3": "No, you cannot sweat underwater in the typical sense. Sweating is the body's way of cooling down through the evaporation of moisture on the skin. Underwater, evaporation cannot occur because the skin is already surrounded by water, so the sweat glands do not produce sweat in the same way. However, your body can still overheat or regulate temperature through other mechanisms, like blood flow adjustments."
