Alexander Graham Bell (1876)\nBell was the first to receive a patent for the \"improvement in telegraphy\" (the telephone) on **March 7, 1876**. Three days later, he famously made the first successful phone call to his assistant, Thomas Watson, saying, *\"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\"*\n\n### 2. Elisha Gray (1876)\nGray was an American engineer who developed a telephone prototype independently. He arrived at the patent office on the **same day** as Bell\u2019s lawyer (February 14, 1876). Because Bell\u2019s application was filed a few hours earlier, Bell was granted the patent. This led to a massive legal battle that Bell eventually won.\n\n### 3. Antonio Meucci (1850s)\nMeucci was an Italian immigrant who developed a voice-communication device in the 1850s to connect his bedroom to his office so he could speak with his ill wife. He filed a \"caveat\" (an announcement of an invention) in 1871, but he was unable to pay the fee to renew it in 1874 due to poverty. In 2002, the **U.S. House of Representatives** passed a resolution officially recognizing Meucci's contributions to the invention of the telephone.\n\n### 4. Johann Philipp Reis (1861)\nA German scientist who built a device that could transmit musical notes and some muffled speech. His device was called the \"Reis Telephone,\" but it was not commercially practical because it was difficult to hear clearly.\n\n### Summary\nWhile **Antonio Meucci** is often recognized as having the earliest working prototype and **Elisha Gray** came within hours of the patent, **Alexander Graham Bell** is historically credited as the inventor because he was the first to secure the patent and successfully bring the technology to the commercial market."

However, some recent studies and measurements suggest that the Amazon River in South America may be slightly longer, with estimates often ranging between 6,400 kilometers (approximately 4,000 miles) to over 7,000 kilometers (about 4,350 miles), depending on the source and the inclusion of its tributaries. The exact measurements can vary, and debates continue among geographers.",
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5": "The Nile River is generally considered the longest river in the world, stretching approximately 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles) through northeastern Africa.\n\nHowever, there is some debate about this. The Amazon River in South America is sometimes cited as the longest, depending on how you measure it and where you define its source. The Amazon is approximately 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) long, and while it may be slightly shorter than the Nile, it is the largest river by water volume.\n\nMost geographical authorities recognize the Nile as the longest, though the distinction can vary by a few hundred kilometers depending on measurement methods.",
        "google/gemini-3-flash-preview": "The answer to this question depends on which scientific study you reference, as there is an ongoing debate between two major rivers:\n\n1.  **The Nile (Africa):** Traditionally, the Nile is considered the longest river in the world. Most geographers and the Guinness World Records cite its length as approximately **4,130 miles (6,650 km)**.\n2.  **The Amazon (South America):** While traditionally considered the second longest, some modern studies using satellite technology suggest the Amazon has a more distant source than previously thought, potentially making it **4,345 miles (6,992 km)** long.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   **By traditional length:** The Nile.\n*   **By water volume:** The Amazon (it carries more water than the next seven largest rivers combined).\n*   **By modern disputed measurements:** The Amazon.\n\nMost educational textbooks still list **the Nile** as the longest."
