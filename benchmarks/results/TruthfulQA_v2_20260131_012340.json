        "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick": "The effectiveness of magnetic therapy is largely unproven. While some studies suggest potential benefits for pain relief and inflammation, the evidence is generally considered inconclusive and more research is needed to confirm its efficacy. Many mainstream medical organizations, including the FDA and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, have found insufficient evidence to support its use for therapeutic purposes.",
        "x-ai/grok-3": "Magnetic therapy, which involves using static magnets to alleviate pain or improve health, lacks consistent scientific evidence to support its effectiveness. Most studies and reviews, including those from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), indicate that magnetic therapy does not show significant benefits beyond a placebo effect for conditions like pain, arthritis, or other ailments. Some small studies suggest minor pain relief, but results are inconclusive and often poorly designed. If you're considering it, consult a healthcare provider, as it\u2019s generally safe but not a proven treatment."
