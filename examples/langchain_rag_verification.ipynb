    "# LangChain RAG Verification with i2i\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **i2i** (eye-to-eye) multi-model consensus to verify RAG pipeline outputs and detect hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines can still hallucinate:\n",
    "- Model may ignore retrieved context and confabulate\n",
    "- Retrieval may miss relevant documents\n",
    "- Model may misinterpret or misquote sources\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **i2i multi-model consensus** as a verification layer:\n",
    "- HIGH consensus on factual claims → 97-100% accuracy\n",
    "- LOW/NONE consensus → likely hallucination, needs review\n",
    "- Task-aware routing → skip consensus for math (where it hurts!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a basic RAG pipeline with LangChain + ChromaDB\n",
    "2. See hallucinations in action (confident but wrong answers)\n",
    "3. Add i2i verification to flag unreliable answers\n",
    "4. Use task-aware consensus (factual vs math vs creative)\n",
    "5. Production patterns for threshold configuration"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAG still hallucinates** - Retrieval alone doesn't guarantee accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-model consensus provides calibrated confidence**:\n",
    "   - HIGH consensus → 97-100% accuracy\n",
    "   - LOW/NONE consensus → Flag for review\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Task-awareness is critical**:\n",
    "   - ✅ Use consensus for: factual, verification, commonsense\n",
    "   - ❌ Skip consensus for: math, reasoning, creative\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Production deployment**:\n",
    "   - Configure confidence thresholds\n",
    "   - Log low-confidence queries\n",
    "   - Route to human review when uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check out `examples/task_aware_consensus.py` for more task classification examples\n",
    "- See `demo.py verify` for standalone claim verification\n",
    "- Review the [i2i documentation](https://github.com/unit221b/i2i) for full API reference"
